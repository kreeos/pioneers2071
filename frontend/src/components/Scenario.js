                        A country called Grainland gained independence just
                        after a global war ended, and struggled with extreme
                        poverty. Over time, other countries repaired themselves
                        from the scars of the war and boosted development
                        through the massive operation of factories that
                        constantly emit smoke. In contrast, the people of
                        Grainland have barely made ends meet by farming and
                        breeding livestock in difficult conditions without
                        electrical facilities and waterworks. While other
                        countries have achieved a high level of national growth,
                        Grainland just began stepping forward with national
                        development.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Over several decades, emissions that were discharged
                        from the numerous factories in other countries have
                        elevated the temperature of the Earth and worsened the
                        air quality, which is causing the plants to wither.
                        Countries around the world are only now aware of the
                        crisis. However, Grainland has become a developing
                        country with a rapid growth rate. The smoke that is
                        being emitted from factories in this country is
                        constantly mixing with the murky air and covering the
                        world. International treaties have been drawn up to
                        prevent smoke from being generated, and other countries
                        are expressing their discontent over Grainland.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Grainland was slow in entering the race of national
                        growth. It can now actively operate industries, but this
                        process is causing air pollutant emissions. Other
                        countries accomplished considerable development through
                        large-scale operation of factories in the past, whereas
                        Grainland is only now engaging in national development.
                        Although Grainland can advance itself at present, issues
                        with its economic development are colliding with global
                        environmental issues. Besides, developed countries are
                        trying to apply universal conditions to the small
                        country of Grainland in terms of environmental issues.
                        People in Grainland are also suffering from the air that
                        is full of smoke, and this country has met with
                        difficulty in making its decisions.

                        A new infectious disease breaks out in 2031. Scientists
                        estimate that this disease is a type of coronavirus that
                        has not been observed on the Earth for hundreds of
                        years. In particular, the contagiousness of this disease
                        is analyzed to be the highest among other infectious
                        diseases that have recently spread on the Earth. As it
                        has a long incubation period, people cannot easily be
                        aware that they have the disease when they are already
                        infected. Moreover, people face a risk of infection even
                        in less-populated areas given that the virus can be
                        transmitted from person to person through both
                        respiratory droplets and aerosols in the air. The spread
                        of this disease finally reaches a city named
                        “Mountwest”, in which many people reside. Although a
                        case of a group infection has not yet been observed,
                        confirmed cases of the virus have been intermittently
                        reported. The government is deeply concerned about this
                        city, and rumor has it that a full-scale lockdown is
                        being considered due to the high contagiousness of the
                        disease.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        People living in Mountwest are extremely scared about
                        the outbreak of the new infectious disease. This city
                        had seen the outbreak of another infectious disease in
                        the past. The disease infection cycle has shortened over
                        time, and a new type of disease has developed in 2031.
                        People have become exhausted by repeated infectious
                        diseases. People are experiencing a high level of
                        fatigue and depression due to social distancing. The
                        spread of an infectious disease might threaten the lives
                        of some people and significantly shrink economic
                        activities. Consequently, some people could have
                        difficulties due to reduced incomes, while others could
                        be at risk of losing their jobs. This is not a simple
                        problem of getting infected or not.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        As described above, an infectious disease is one of the
                        greatest threats latent in a modern society that
                        includes numerous people. What measures can enable
                        people in Mountwest to maintain decent human lives
                        despite the danger of infectious disease?

                      <p>
                        In the year 2071, a completely new era of technological
                        development has come. Artificial intelligence (AI) has
                        evolved to outperform humans in various fields, and
                        companies and countries with the best AI technology,
                        including the country Aerok, have created massive
                        amounts of wealth. Gradually, AI has replaced more and
                        more people’s jobs, and Aerok has introduced a universal
                        basic income system that allows people to live a
                        sufficiently plentiful life without any additional
                        income. However, many people still crave wealth and
                        desire to take the remaining few jobs, which has caused
                        an intensive education fever in Aerok. In response to
                        the situation, the government has introduced a new
                        education policy called the “TITLE” (Test of
                        Intelligence: Technology & Linguistics Examination) to
                        control the excessive education fever.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        “TITLE” has successfully selected the optimal number of
                        best students, but still, it has failed to reduce
                        excessively competitive atmospheres in schools. Students
                        dreaming of entering the top-ranking universities have
                        to study day and night, which is putting them under
                        considerable amounts of academic stress. Moreover, the
                        few aristocracies of the society and the largest,
                        wealthiest companies have started to “kick away the
                        ladder.” The flow of wealth into the AI industry has
                        increased year after year, and this has intensified not
                        only education fever but also the conflict between the
                        privileged class and the rest of the society. Aerok is
                        currently facing a complicated, problematic situation
                        wherein both education and careers face substantial
                        problems in the society, requiring careful yet adequate
                        solutions.
